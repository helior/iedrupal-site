I just don't want him to point out my cracker ass in front of Ann. Dad would stage elaborate situations using a one-armed man to teach us lessons. I'll sacrifice anything for my children. Maybe it was the other George Michael. You know, the singer-songwriter. No. I was ashamed to be _seen_ with you. I like being with you.

HUZZAH! Taste the happy, Michael. Taste it. It tastes kind of like sad. Ah, it is a rock, though. Should beat everything. Gob: There's not a lot of logic to it. If you're suggesting I play favorites, you're wrong. I love all of my children equally. [earlier] I don't care for Gob. I've been in the film business for a while but I just can't seem to get one in the can. With spicy club sauce. WHY was this show cancelled? I mean, COME ON.</div></div></div></section></div><footer id="footer"><div class="ribbon"></div><div class="map"><div class="inland-empire-ca"></div></div><div class="footer-inner"><ul><li><a href="/">Home</a></li><li><a href="/events">Events</a></li><li><a href="/sponsors">Sponsors</a></li><li><a href="/about">About</a></li><li><a href="/venue">Venue</a></li><li><a href="/contact">Contact</a></li></ul></div></footer><script src="//ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.10.2/jquery.min.js" type="text/javascript"></script><script src="/assets/js/app.js" type="text/javascript"></script></body></html>
